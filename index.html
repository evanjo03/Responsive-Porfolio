        <p class="bio">My name is John Evans, and I grew up in the greater Madison, Wisconsin area. I always had a passion for numbers
            and thoroughly enjoyed my early mathematics classes in highschool. I attended Luther College in Iowa, and
            studied math theory and applications there. While enrolled at Luther, I participated in a few different clubs,
            including math club, and also played on the school's ultimate frisbee team. </p>
        <p class="bio">
            After graduation, I moved with a few fellow Luther grads to the Twin Cities area, settling into the suburbs to
            the south while looking for a job. I ended up working in financial services for the global chemical company,
            Ecolab, and worked in data mining and work order management for corporate customers, which is where I currently work. While I have learned a lot working at Ecolab, I believe my career lies outside the realm of finance. I
            am hoping to move into the tech industry to work in the software development field, data analytics, or similar,
            and cannot wait to see what opportunities await!</p>
